###Virtual Tour

Mid-term project for Code Fellows Front-End Development Accelerator.

Web app that provides users with travel inspiration in photos and articles

Users can search for photos on Flickr and articles on WikiVoyage for travel inspiration. The bxSlider carousel displays the photos and adapts to photos and viewports of different sizes. After creating an account, a user can favorite a result by clicking the heart. This saves it to a travel plan in their account.

**Technologies**
* Uses the Flickr API, the WikiVoyage API, Skeleton grid, bxSlider, and Firebase
* I implemented the Flickr and mediawiki API calls to search for photos and articles
* I used bxSlider to display the photo search results and Skeleton grid for layout
